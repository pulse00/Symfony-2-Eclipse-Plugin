#Symfony Eclipse Plugin

## The Plugin is still beta and REQUIRES a development build of the PHP Development Tools at the moment. It will not work with the current PDT Version available via the eclipse update site.

The PDT development plugin is integrated in the updatesite of the symfony plugin:

### http://pulse00.github.com/updatesite/

To install the plugin, add the above updatesite to your eclipse installation:

![Symfony install1](http://pulse00.github.com/Symfony-2-Eclipse-Plugin/images/install_1.png)

Then select the Symfony plugin and the PHP Development Tools:

![Symfony install1](http://pulse00.github.com/Symfony-2-Eclipse-Plugin/images/install_2.png)


If you've previously use a nightly build, you need to uninstall it and install the newest version of PDT from the updatesite above.
