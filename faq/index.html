  	<div class="faq">  		
		<h2 class="question">I'm getting a lot of errors/warnings after installation. What's up with that?</h2>
		<p class="answer">

			The Symfony2 standard edition comes with various vendor libraries. Those libraries contain php files which cause PHP Syntax errors when indexed
			by the PDT plugin - for example because they are solely test files that should trigger those errors or skeleton files with placeholders inside.
			
			The Symfony plugin creates initial exclusion patterns for the standard edition, which should avoid those syntax errors for Tests, skeleton files and
			fixtures in the vendor folder.
			
			However, in a default eclipse installation, you'll see exact 9 errors in a fresh Symfony project, which are out of the scope of the plugin to solve though:<br/><br/>
						
			<h4>XML Problem</h4>
			<p>The XML Problem indicates that the XML validator (<span class="warning">NOT</span> part of this plugin!!) found a problem in an XML file or an XSD schema. Some of the schemas in Symfony core contain invalid complex types, 
			which is a known issue and will not be resolved (see <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/symfony/symfony/issues/2122">this thread</a> for more info). To hide those errors, you need to disable XML/XSD validation from the 
			Eclipse preferences` "validation" tab. If you don't see this tab, you need to install the "Eclipse Web Development Tools" plugin from the standard updatesite.</p>

		<h2 class="question"><a href="#symfony-aware">How do i know a PHP project is symfony-aware?</a></h2>
		<p class="answer">Check for a "Symfony Builder" in the projects builders - <span class="eclipsehint">project -> Properties -> Builders</span>. If it's not there, run the "Add/Remove Symfony Nature" (right-click on the project in the <span class="eclipsehint">package explorer -> Symfony -> Add/Remove Symfony Nature</span>).</p>

	<div class="faq">					
		<h2 class="question"><a href="#no-service-completion">Service XYZ is not being completed at all, but others are. How come?</a></h2>
		<p class="answer">The plugin cannot infer types of synthetic services - services which are dynamically injected during runtime. For those cases, there's a preference page called <b>Services</b> where the id/class mapping can be stored. After that, the plugin should complete the service properly.</p>

	<div class="faq">					
		<h2 class="question"><a href="#no-codeassist">There's no additional codeassistance showing up, what can i do?</a></h2>
		<p class="answer">The plugin indexes services and annotation during the build process. Try to clean the project (<span class="eclipsehint">project -> clean</span>). If it's still not working, check if the project has a Symfony nature.</p>					
	</div>
	
	<div class="faq">					
		<h2 class="question"><a href="#no-codeassist2">Still no code assist, what now?</a></h2>
		<p class="answer">Check your build-path - <span class="eclipsehint"> project -> properties -> PHP build path</span> - and ensure that all your source folders are in the build path. Also make sure that none of your sourcefolders are excluded.</p>					
	</div>

	<div class="faq">					
		<h2 class="question"><a href="#pdt-completion-broken">The plugin broke the built in PHP code completion!?!</a></h2>
		<p class="answer">Sorry about that ;) To check that it's really the plugins fault, first remove the symfony nature, clean your project and try again. If you're getting code assist, it's probably the plugin causing it. If not, you're build-path is probably misconfigured.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="faq">					
		<h2 class="question"><a href="#troubleshooting">Okay, it seems the plugin broke it, how can i figure out what's wrong?</a></h2>
		<p class="answer">Eclipse can be started with various debugging options. This can be turned on/off for each installed plugin independently. To debug the symfony plugin, create a file called <span class="code">.options</span> in your Eclipse installation folder. The file should contain the following lines:
			
			<p class="code indent-1">				
				org.eclipse.dltk.core/debug=true<br/>			
				com.dubture.symfony.core/debug=true<br/>
				com.dubture.symfony.annotation/debug=true<br/>				
				com.dubture.symfony.index/debug=true<br/>
				com.dubture.symfony.ui/debug=true<br/>
			</p>
			
			Then restart eclipse from the commandline with these flags: <span class="code">eclipse -debug .options</span>						
			<p>Try to reproduce the problem and monitor the commandline - please provide these stacktraces in your github issues.</p>
			</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="faq">					
		<h2 class="question"><a href="#plugin-version">How do i know which version of the plugin is installed?</a></h2>
		<p class="answer"> <span class="eclipsehint">Eclipse(Mac) / Help(Windows/Linux) -> About Eclipse -> SDK -> Installation Details -> Plugins </span> lists all installed plugins and their version. Note that the Symfony eclipse Feature actually consists of multiple plugins listed on that page.</p>
